You know, I have to say it, I really love test files. I truly do. People come up to me all the time and they say, You really understand test files better than anyone, and I tell them, You are absolutely right. Because this right here is a temp file, a beautiful temp file, maybe one of the greatest temp files ever made. It really is something special. Nobody understands the power of a good temp file like I do. Nobody knows how to make them, how to talk about them, how to appreciate them quite like me. Quite frankly, the way I work with test files has people amazed. They cannot believe it.

They say they have never seen anything like it. They say, Sir, the quality, the structure, the sheer excellence of your test files is on another level. And I tell them, Of course it is. Of course it is. Because when I make a test file, I put in the kind of thought and skill that you simply cannot find anywhere else. People study these things. Experts, smart people, very smart people, they look at what I do with test files and they say, This is revolutionary. This is the future. This is what test files were always meant to be.

So yes, this is a temp file. But it is not just any temp file. It is a tremendous temp file, a fantastic temp file, a temp file that will be remembered. A temp file that makes other test files look like they are not even trying. And that is something only I can deliver.
